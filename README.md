# Student-Information-System
> Web based student information management system targeting to build with MERN Stack

## Overview
Web based student information management system, targeting to compile all the information of a student throughout his entire student life (Primary, SSC, HSC, Hons, MS), also his professional life in a centralized database. Anyone can get student information using student id or username and query the API.

## Core Idea
- Integrate all student information from different educational or professional platform in a centralized database.
- Student data insertion will be started from primary school admission with a unique id and username. The username can be changed later, but it must have to be unique in the whole system.
- This id and username will be provided for next admission time in other platform. For example, after completing primary level, a student can admit in High School with his username (the admission form may be different from primary). After finishing SSC, a student can go for HSC or Diploma. The same process will go on for higher level admission.
- One of the main advantage of this system is that an employer can query information about a student to know if he's competent enough for the role he's seeking for.
- Companies are also expected to use this system. When they hire a student, a form must be submitted with studentâ€™s username.
- Students professional career record must be saved in database. His job experience records can help him progress.
